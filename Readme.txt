Ideas for future improvements
1. Impliment Presets / settings/ round count/ etc.
  More Functionality
  Less harcoded to Mount Rushmore and Snake Specific Drafts

2. Allow Leaderboards for less than 3 minimum players
  requires segmenting the trophy icon for each winner into rows
  Centered with helper function by a multiple of displayed trophies based on playercount
  saving those lines to an double dynamic array
  and printing them out row by row
  maybe functionality to add more trophies for more players
  i.e, 2 Players = 1 Trophy, 4 Players = 3 trophies, 8 players = 4 trophies, etc.

3. File System to be read in at launch
  This opens the door for so much automation
  i.e 
  1. Presets being loaded in
  2. Players being saved and loaded in w/o retyping
  3. ability to save points for repeated use over time
  4. added functionality of the settings menu in the program

  Idea:
  require two main files
  1. Settings file
    This holds all info required at startup
    for example
      a. name of save file (Prompted at launch)
      b. Preset
      c.
